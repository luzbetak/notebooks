<DD>          I was able to find the old 1982 "biomedical dataset"
                generated by Larry Cox. It consists of two groups.
                These give observation number, blood id number,age,
                date, and four blood measurements.  I don't really
                remember the instructions for analysis, although I
                seem to recall that the idea was to figure out if some
                of the blood measurements that were less difficult to
                obtain were as good at distinguishing carriers from
                normals as the more difficult measurements.
                Unfortunately, I don't remeember which
                measurement is which.

A remittitur is a ruling from a judge, in response to the motion of a defendant found liable, such that the plaintiff can choose between reducing the amount granted by a the jury for indemnification or a new trial. This ruling is valid when the amount granted by the jury is unreasonable. 
<br>
In order to define what is unreasonable compensation, Judge Weinstein collected a pool of 86 cases in which there were awards for pain and suffering, Next, he decided if the damage dealt to each of the 3 plaintiffs was comparable to that on each case in the pool. This database is composed by Judge Weinstein's decision on comparability and information about the 86 cases in the pool."

                there are 26 files in all. Each of the 25 files has
                the data in an ascii comma separated format.  The name of each
                data file is the name of the data set used in the
                book. To find the description of the data set in the
                book look under the entry "data, name" in the index.
                For example, one data set is barley. To find the
                description of barley, look in the index under the
                entry "data, barley".  The S archive of Statlib has a
                file created by S that contains the data sets in a
                format that makes it easy to read them into S.
